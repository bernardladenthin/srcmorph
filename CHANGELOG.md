## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Bumped `jackson.version` 2.22.0 → 2.22.1 (`jackson-databind` / `jackson-dataformat-yaml`,
  pinned in the parent `pom.xml`) to close
  [GHSA-5jmj-h7xm-6q6v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5jmj-h7xm-6q6v) (CVSS 5.3, Medium),
  flagged by OSV-Scanner against `srcmorph/pom.xml` and `srcmorph-cli/pom.xml` after the `main`
  merge of the relocation-stub removal.

### Removed
- **Relocation-stub module** (`llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin/`, `net.ladenthin:llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin`)
  removed from the active reactor. It was published once at `1.0.4` as part of the `1.1.1` release
  and the redirect verified working end-to-end (a clean-environment Maven resolution of the old
  coordinates correctly follows the relocation through to `srcmorph-maven-plugin:1.1.1` and its
  full dependency graph). The published `1.0.4` artifact is permanent on Maven Central regardless
  of this repo's module list and will never need another release, so there is no reason to keep
  carrying the module (and the `versions:set -Dexcludes=...` caveat it required) in ongoing
  development. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` updated accordingly (no more per-module handling for
  a fourth artifact).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Reactor split**: the former single-module `llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin` is now a 3-module
  Maven reactor under a new parent, `net.ladenthin:srcmorph-parent` — `srcmorph` (new core library,
  `net.ladenthin:srcmorph`, framework-free — no Maven Plugin API dependency), `srcmorph-cli` (new
  standalone CLI, `net.ladenthin:srcmorph-cli`, driven by a single JSON/YAML configuration file,
  ships as a `java -jar`-ready fat jar), and `srcmorph-maven-plugin` (the original plugin, now a
  thin wrapper depending on `srcmorph`). All three (plus the parent pom) release together at one
  shared version.
- **Plugin renamed** from `net.ladenthin:llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin` to
  `net.ladenthin:srcmorph-maven-plugin` in this same release (goal prefix `ai-index` → `srcmorph`;
  package `net.ladenthin.maven.llamacpp.aiindex.mojo` → `net.ladenthin.maven.srcmorph.mojo`; every
  `@Parameter` property `aiIndex.*` → `srcmorph.*`). A new, independently-versioned relocation-stub
  module/POM (`net.ladenthin:llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin:1.0.4`, no source, no dependencies, only
  `<distributionManagement><relocation>`) keeps the old coordinates resolvable on Maven Central,
  redirecting to `net.ladenthin:srcmorph-maven-plugin:1.1.1`.
- New engine layer in `srcmorph` (`GenerateEngine`, `AggregatePackagesEngine`,
  `AggregateProjectEngine`, `CalibrateEngine`) extracted from what used to be each mojo's
  `execute()` body, plus a new shared root configuration object,
  `net.ladenthin.srcmorph.config.SrcMorphConfiguration`, bindable identically from Maven plexus XML,
  Jackson JSON/YAML (the new CLI), or plain Java code.
- New `examples/` directory at the repo root: paired `config_*.json`/`.yaml` fixtures for every
  `srcmorph-cli` command (`Plan`, `GenerateFileIndex`, `All`, `Calibrate`), paired `run_*.sh`/`.bat`
  launcher scripts, and an example `logbackConfiguration.xml` — all runnable out of the box with the
  `mock` provider (no GGUF model required).
- Per-module `README.md` files (`srcmorph/README.md`, `srcmorph-cli/README.md`) and a rewritten,
  product-level root `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` describing the reactor.

### Changed
- Logging in the extracted core/CLI layers moved from a constructor-injected Maven `Log` to
  `org.slf4j.Logger` (see the `1.0.x` entries below for the indexer-layer half of this change,
  already shipped before the reactor split).
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` adapted to the 4-module reactor: per-module jar upload/release
  globs, a repo-wide crash-dump glob, the PIT step scoped to `srcmorph` (the only module with a
  mutation-testing gate), the `vmlens` job scoped to `srcmorph-maven-plugin` (where its
  test actually lives), and Coveralls/Codecov pointed at `srcmorph`'s jacoco report.

### Notes
- **This release renames the Maven plugin's coordinates, package, goal prefix, and `@Parameter`
  property names.** `net.ladenthin:llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin` → `net.ladenthin:srcmorph-maven-plugin`;
  package `net.ladenthin.maven.llamacpp.aiindex.mojo` → `net.ladenthin.maven.srcmorph.mojo`; goal
  prefix `ai-index` → `srcmorph`; every `aiIndex.*` property → `srcmorph.*`. Existing consumers of
  the old coordinates are not broken: a new, independently-versioned relocation-stub artifact
  (`net.ladenthin:llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin:1.0.4`, POM-only, no source/dependencies) is
  published with a `<distributionManagement><relocation>` pointing at
  `net.ladenthin:srcmorph-maven-plugin:1.1.1`, so Maven transparently redirects any build still
  declaring the old artifactId.

### Fixed
- **Sources-jar signing**: `maven-source-plugin`'s `attach-sources` execution was bound to the
  `verify` phase instead of `package` in all three real modules. `maven-gpg-plugin`'s signing
  execution is also bound to `verify`, and within the same phase execution order follows
  declaration/inheritance order — the inherited gpg execution ran before the sources jar was
  built, so it was silently omitted from every signed bundle. Rebound `attach-sources` to
  `package` (its own goal default). Also gave the relocation-stub module a `<parent>` so it
  inherits the release profile's signing/publishing plugins at all (it previously had none),
  while keeping its own version pinned independently.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- Split the big-window size-routing rule per source kind in the `ai-index-selftest` example POM: the former single `big-window` rule is now `big-window-java` (prompt `file-body-java`), and a matching `big-window-sql` rule (prompt `file-body-sql`) routes oversized `.sql` sources to the same large-context model — so an oversized `.sql` file keeps the SQL prompt instead of being misrouted/uncovered.
- Bumped `net.ladenthin:llama` 5.0.3 → 5.0.4.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Third-level **project index** (`aggregate-project` goal): a single `project.ai.md` table of contents harvesting each package's lead, with an optional one-call AI `#### Overview` paragraph.
- **Rule-based file routing** for the `generate` goal: each `<fieldGeneration>` routes a file to a `(model, prompt)` via a composable `<condition>` tree (`<and>`/`<or>`/`<not>` over `extensions`/`size`/`lines`/`modifiedAfter`/`modifiedBefore`/`pathGlob`), with `<priority>`, `<skip>`, and exactly one explicit `<fallback>`. Plan-then-execute loads each model once; `aiIndex.planOnly=true` prints the routing plan tree without loading a model.
- Plan-time **context-window fit check**: oversized files fail the build up front; new big-window fallback preset (IBM Granite 4.0-H-Tiny, Apache-2.0) covers source files up to ~1 MB.
- Independently switchable phases via `aiIndex.file.skip` / `aiIndex.package.skip` / `aiIndex.project.skip` (plus the global `aiIndex.skip`).
- File-size **band filter** (`minFileSizeBytes` / `maxFileSizeBytes`) for size-tiered indexing, and `excludes` globs to skip generated/trivial sources.
- Deterministic child-link list (`F` header field) for project → package → file navigation.
- Per-file **progress bar with ETA** and measured (actual vs estimated) per-file generation time.
- **GPU support**: opt-in `gpu-cuda` / `gpu-vulkan` profiles, parameterized native classifier, and `gpuLayers` / `mainGpu` / `devices` knobs.
- Opt-in sampling controls (default off): `min_p`, `top_n_sigma`, DRY repetition suppression, reasoning/think budget, and model-level `swa-full` + cache-reuse.
- Extension-selected file-body prompts (java / sql / fallback).

### Changed
- Default model preset is now `gpt-oss-20B-mxfp4`; all gpt-oss presets are GPU-ready.
- Pinned `net.ladenthin:llama` to the released `5.0.3` (dropped the SNAPSHOT dependency and snapshot repository).
- Bumped JUnit 6.1.0 → 6.1.1 and palantir-java-format 2.92.0 → 2.94.0.

### Removed
- The empty-body generation retry mechanism.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-08

First public release on Maven Central. Pre-OpenSSF history themes (March–May 2026): Java 8 compatibility, key-indexed `aiDefinitions` (PR #21), Sonatype Central Portal migration, JaCoCo+Coveralls+Codecov, GH Actions major-version bumps, CodeQL v3→v4, model catalogue (Qwen2.5-Coder, Ministral 8B/14B, Gemma 4 MoE).

### Added
- OpenSSF Best Practices badge and passing-level artifacts (CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG.md).

### Changed
- Switched runtime dependency to `net.ladenthin:llama` 5.0.2 (official Maven Central release).
- CI: added `startgate` abort-window environment before publish pipeline.
- CI: separated snapshot and release publish paths; added `check-snapshot` / `check-tag` gate jobs.
- CI: bumped `softprops/action-gh-release` v2 → v3 (Node 24 compatibility).
- CI: added JaCoCo coverage reporting with Coveralls and Codecov integration.
- README: grouped badges by category (Build / Coverage / Package / License / Community); added Maven Central dependency section.

### Fixed
- CI: quoted gate job names to avoid YAML colon-in-scalar parsing error.
- CI: use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Coveralls `github-token` parameter instead of `COVERALLS_TOKEN`.
