# Integration test for srcmorph-maven-plugin: runs the plugin as a PLUGIN, from the local
# repository, through a real Maven lifecycle, against the fixture project in .github/plugin-it/.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Every other test of this module calls Java methods directly --
# PluginArchitectureTest, MojoPhaseSkipTest, MojoConfigurationMappingTest, PIT at 62/62. None of
# them involves Maven, so none of them covers the parts only Maven does:
#
#   * plexus binding of the <configuration> XML onto the mojos' @Parameter fields, including the
#     nested List<AiPromptDefinition> / List<AiModelDefinition> / List<AiFieldGenerationConfig>
#     structures and the <condition><extensions> tree inside them (the CLI's Jackson binding is a
#     DIFFERENT code path -- ExamplesConfigBindingTest covers that one, not this one);
#   * goal-prefix resolution: that `mvn srcmorph:generate` finds this plugin at all;
#   * the srcmorph.* @Parameter property strings, which nothing else asserts -- rename one and
#     every unit test still passes because they set the field, not the property;
#   * lifecycle-phase binding of the goals, and per-execution <configuration> overriding the
#     plugin-level one;
#   * the descriptor maven-plugin-plugin generates, which is what carries all of the above.
#
# A renamed @Parameter property would have shipped green. That is the gap this closes.
#
# The fixture uses the default `mock` provider, so no GGUF, no GPU and no network are needed, and
# its <configuration> deliberately mirrors the worked example in srcmorph-maven-plugin/README.md --
# so this also fails when the documented XML stops being the XML that works.
#
# NO `-s settings.xml`, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. An earlier version passed a settings.xml whose
# only content was <pluginGroups><pluginGroup>net.ladenthin</pluginGroup></pluginGroups>, on the
# assumption that `mvn srcmorph:generate` needs it. It does not: the fixture declares the plugin in
# its own <build><plugins>, and Maven resolves the prefix by comparing the request against THAT
# plugin's descriptor -- which is exactly the check we want. Adding the pluginGroup opens a second
# resolution path, through the group's repository metadata, which maps srcmorph -> the plugin by
# artifactId regardless of what the descriptor says. Measured: with a mutated <goalPrefix>, the run
# succeeded WITH settings.xml (logging `morphsrc:1.2.0:generate`) and failed without it. The masking
# is not a stale-local-repo artifact either -- Central serves net/ladenthin/maven-metadata.xml
# carrying <prefix>srcmorph</prefix>, so a pristine runner would be masked too. Do not reintroduce
# that file.
#
# Usage: plugin-it.sh <reactor-version>
#   The reactor must already be installed into the local repository, e.g.
#   mvn -B -pl srcmorph-maven-plugin -am -Dmaven.test.skip=true install
