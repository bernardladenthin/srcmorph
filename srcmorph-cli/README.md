# srcmorph-cli

`net.ladenthin:srcmorph-cli` is a standalone command-line front end for
[srcmorph](../README.md): a single `java -jar` invocation driven by one JSON or YAML configuration
file, with no Maven project or build required. It wraps the
[`srcmorph`](../srcmorph/README.md) core library's engines exactly the way the
[Maven plugin](../srcmorph-maven-plugin/README.md) does, following the
[BitcoinAddressFinder](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder) `cli.Main` pattern.

## Running it

```bash
java -jar srcmorph-cli-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar <path-to-config.json-or-.yaml>
```

The fat jar (`srcmorph-cli-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`, built by `mvn package`) bundles every
dependency, including a logback binding, so it runs standalone. Both `.json`/`.js` (parsed via a
Jackson `ObjectMapper`) and `.yaml`/`.yml` (parsed via `YAMLMapper`) are supported — pick whichever you
prefer; both mappers are configured strictly (`FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES`), so a typo'd key fails the
run immediately rather than being silently ignored. On startup the CLI logs the parsed configuration
back to you (re-serialized as both JSON and YAML) so you can confirm exactly what will run before any
model loads or file is written.

See [`../examples/`](../examples/) for a complete, ready-to-run set of `config_*.json`/`.yaml` files
(all using the `mock` provider, so they run with no GGUF model on disk) plus paired
`run_*.sh`/`run_*.bat` launcher scripts and an example `logbackConfiguration.xml`.

## Config-file reference

The root object is `net.ladenthin.srcmorph.cli.configuration.CConfiguration` — a plain, public-field
JavaBean (Jackson binds it directly, no getters/setters needed):

```java
public class CConfiguration {
    public CCommand command = CCommand.Plan;
    public SrcMorphConfiguration srcMorph = new SrcMorphConfiguration();
}
```

- **`command`** — one of the six `CCommand` values below. Defaults to `Plan` — the safe default: no
  command means no model load and nothing written.
- **`srcMorph`** — the **same** `net.ladenthin.srcmorph.config.SrcMorphConfiguration` object the Maven
  plugin's mojos build from their own `@Parameter` fields. **Every key under `srcMorph` in your JSON/YAML
  file reads identically to the matching Maven `<configuration>` XML element** — `baseDirectory`,
  `outputDirectory`, `subtrees`, `excludes`, `fileExtensions`, `generationProvider`,
  `promptDefinitions`, `aiDefinitions`, `fieldGenerations`, `factDefinitions`, the `llama*` fallback
  parameters, `force`, `planOnly`, `projectName`. If you already know the plugin's XML shape, you
  already know this shape — see
  [`../srcmorph-maven-plugin/README.md`](../srcmorph-maven-plugin/README.md)'s
  "Configuration" section for the full field-by-field reference (routing-rule conditions, oversize
  strategies, per-model sampling parameters, etc.), which applies verbatim here.

### The six `CCommand` values

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Plan` | Runs `GenerateEngine` with `planOnly` **forced** to `true`, regardless of what the file says — builds and logs the routing plan (which model + prompt each file would get) and stops. No model is loaded, nothing is written. The default; always safe to run. |
| `GenerateFileIndex` | Phase 1, exactly as configured: indexes source files and fills in their AI-generated summaries (`GenerateEngine`). |
| `AggregatePackages` | Phase 2: aggregates per-package `.ai.md` index files (`AggregatePackagesEngine`). |
| `AggregateProject` | Phase 3: aggregates the single project-level `.ai.md` index (`AggregateProjectEngine`). |
| `All` | Runs `GenerateFileIndex`, then `AggregatePackages`, then `AggregateProject` in order, stopping at the first phase that fails. |
| `Calibrate` | Loads each distinct model your `fieldGenerations` would route to, measures its prefill/decode throughput, and prints a paste-ready `<calibration>` XML block per model to standard output (`CalibrateEngine`). |

### One shared `srcMorph` object across commands — a nuance to know

Unlike the Maven plugin, where each goal execution gets its **own** `<fieldGenerations>` block in the
POM, the CLI's `All` and `Calibrate` commands reuse the **one** `srcMorph.fieldGenerations` list across
every engine they run. That list means different things to different engines:

- **`GenerateFileIndex`** *routes*: each file is matched to exactly one rule by `condition` + `priority`
  (the explicit `fallback` catches anything unmatched).
- **`AggregatePackages`** does **not** route by condition — it applies **every** entry in
  `fieldGenerations` to every package, in list order, and the **last** entry's output is kept.
- **`AggregateProject`**'s optional AI overview paragraph uses only `fieldGenerations[0]`.

If your `fieldGenerations` list has more than one entry (e.g. a conditioned Java-file rule plus a
fallback, as in [`../examples/config_All.json`](../examples/config_All.json)), running `All` will
still aggregate every package using the *entire* list's rules layered on top of each other (last one
wins) — which is usually fine (the rules typically write similar structured Markdown), but is worth
knowing if you see a package's body reflecting your fallback rule's prompt rather than the
file-specific one. A single fallback-only rule sidesteps the question entirely and behaves identically
across all three phases. See [`../srcmorph/README.md`](../srcmorph/README.md) for the engine-level
detail.

## Testing

- `MainTest` — unit tests for the extension-dispatched loader and the JSON/YAML mappers.
- `configuration.ConfigBindingTest` — round-trips a private ad-hoc
  `src/test/resources/test-fixtures/minimal-generate.{json,yaml}` fixture pair.
- `ExamplesConfigBindingTest` — sweeps every shipped `../examples/config_*.{json,yaml}` file (the
  public, documented examples) through the same strict mappers, so an example can never silently drift
  out of sync with `SrcMorphConfiguration`'s field set.
- `CliEndToEndTest` — drives `Main#run()` directly (no forked process) against the `mock` provider for
  the `All` and `Plan` commands, asserting the expected `.ai.md` tree lands on disk (or, for `Plan`,
  that nothing is written and the original configuration object is never mutated).
- `CliArchitectureTest` — ArchUnit rules: this module is the reactor's leaf-most consumer, no public
  mutable fields outside `configuration`, no `System.exit`, no dependency on the Maven Plugin API.

## Building

```bash
mvn -pl srcmorph-cli -am package
```

produces `srcmorph-cli/target/srcmorph-cli-<version>.jar` (plain jar) and
`srcmorph-cli/target/srcmorph-cli-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar` (the fat jar you actually run —
bound unconditionally to the `package` phase, since for this module the fat jar *is* the deliverable).
