# TODO — srcmorph reactor (Maven plugin now `srcmorph-maven-plugin`, formerly `llamacpp-ai-index-maven-plugin`)

Open work items for this repo. Cross-cutting tracking lives in
[`../workspace/crossrepostatus.md`](../workspace/crossrepostatus.md); items here are
repo-specific or this repo's slice of a cross-cutting initiative.

**Completed work is not recorded here.** It lives in git history and in
`crossrepostatus.md`; a finished item is deleted from this file rather than annotated, so
everything below is genuinely still open.

## Open

- **`main` does not build: `net.ladenthin:llama` 5.2.0 was never released.** `srcmorph/pom.xml`
  pins `<llama.version>5.2.0</llama.version>` (commit `5b4abeb`, 2026-09-01, *"pin
  net.ladenthin:llama to the 5.2.0 release, not the snapshot"*), but that release does not exist:
  Central's newest is `5.1.0` and `llama-5.2.0.pom` returns HTTP 404. This reactor declares no
  repository besides Central, so nothing can resolve it. **Every PR run since 2026-09-01 is red**
  at the first Maven step — run `33962068246`, job `101297417993`: `Could not find artifact
  net.ladenthin:llama:jar:5.2.0 in central`, BUILD FAILURE after 3.35 s — while the matching `main`
  runs were all `cancelled` by the start gate, so no red `main` was ever visible and the cause went
  unattributed for over a week. It also passes locally on any machine where an earlier `mvn install`
  of java-llama.cpp left 5.2.0 in `~/.m2`, which is why "verified locally: reactor mvn clean verify
  green" appears in commit messages from that window; reproduce the real state with
  `mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/empty dependency:get -Dartifact=net.ladenthin:llama:5.2.0`.
  **Reverting to `5.1.0` is not obviously correct** — `229903c` had raised the pin to
  `5.2.0-SNAPSHOT` precisely because the newer binding "can express" flashAttn, so 5.1.0 may not
  carry the API `LlamaCppJniConfigFactory` uses. java-llama.cpp's `main` sits at `5.2.0-SNAPSHOT`,
  so publishing that release is the likelier fix. Decide which, then re-run CI to confirm — this is
  the one item here that blocks everything else in the repo.

- **The sixteen GPU classifier fat jars are verified structurally, never launched.** Since 1.2.0
  `.github/verify-classifier-fatjars.sh` asserts each is the artifact its name claims (one jar per
  classifier, a native for the promised OS/arch, a native set that differs from the default jar's, so
  a broken `-Dllama.classifier=` cannot silently ship seventeen CPU builds). What it cannot assert is
  that the jar *works*: a GitHub-hosted runner has no CUDA/ROCm/SYCL/OpenVINO device, and the only
  command that would load the native library is a real generation. Closing this needs hardware —
  a self-hosted runner, or a manual pre-release pass on one GPU box per backend. Worth knowing which
  half is covered before reading the green check as "the CUDA jar runs".

- **jqwik pin policy** — see [`../workspace/policies/jqwik-prompt-injection.md`](../workspace/policies/jqwik-prompt-injection.md). `jqwik.version ≤ 1.9.3` is mandatory (declared in `srcmorph/pom.xml`, the only reactor module with a jqwik test dependency).

- **`@VisibleForTesting` audit.** Nothing is annotated, but the members exist: `provider.LlamaCppJniAiGenerationProvider` has four (`buildChatTemplateKwargs`, `buildInferenceParameters`, `warnOnTruncatedAnswer`, `logPromptCacheReuse`) plus the static `tensorReadLazyMode`/`cacheType`, `document.AiMdDocumentCodec` has `read(List)`/`write`, `prompt.AiPromptPreparationSupport` has `trimSourceAtLineBreak`, and the three mojos have their `build*Configuration()`. Guava is not a dependency, so closing this means either a project-local marker annotation (there is precedent: `support.ConvertToRecord`) or recording that the convention is not adopted here. Decide and act rather than re-auditing.

- **Null-safety refinement.** JSpecify + NullAway are enforced at compile time in strict JSpecify mode in every module (see each module's own `pom.xml`); `@NullMarked` on the package; framework-populated POJOs carry class-level `@SuppressWarnings({"NullAway.Init","initialization.fields.uninitialized"})`. Open follow-up: review remaining unannotated public API surfaces for places where `@Nullable` would be more precise than the implicit non-null default.

- **Cross-repo code-quality TODOs** — see [`../workspace/policies/code-quality-todos.md`](../workspace/policies/code-quality-todos.md) for the canonical `@VisibleForTesting` design-fit review, package hierarchy review, and class/method naming review. This repo has no `@VisibleForTesting` usages today; the package and naming reviews are still open here.
